# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This was the first ever react-native App I made as part of JS Mastery's react-native tutorial. Restate is an app that simple lists real estate properties available in the marker.
It utilizes Appwrite for the backend DB where it stores user information and property information. The app implements a Search feature where it collectes a Query and navigates the
user to a page where the query is performed be searching the Appwrite database. The main thing I learned from this tutorial was how tranferable my knoweldge of react was to react-native.
On top of that, utilize Nativewing made styling the app so much easier.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
